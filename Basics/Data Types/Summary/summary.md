### Data types

Primitive (Call by Value)

- 7 Types : String,Number,Bigint,Boolean,null,undefined,Symbol

Non Primitive (call by reference)

- Array, object, Functions

### Call By Value

- There are two copies of parameters stored in different memory locations.
- One is the original copy and the other is the function copy.
- Any changes made inside functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.

### Call by Reference

- Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations.
- Any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.

## Typed languages

Type checking is the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types.

**Javascript is a dynamically typed language.**

### Statically typed languages

- Type checking at compile-time.
- Examples: Java, C, C++,Typescript.

### Dynamically typed languages

- Type checking at run-time.
- Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript.
