### Call By Value

- There are two copies of parameters stored in different memory locations.
- One is the original copy and the other is the function copy.
- Any changes made inside functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.

### Call by Reference

- Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations.
- Any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.
