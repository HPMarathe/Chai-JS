### Ways to define a variable

Variable is usually used to store data

```
const accountId = 66060;

var accountNo = 575757;

let details = "some";

accountCity = "mumbai";
```

Prefer not to use var because of issues in block scope & functional scope.

### How to change a value assigned to a variable

```
const accountId = 66060;
accountId =777 //not alllowed

<!-- same for var & let -->
let details = "some"
details = "any"
```
